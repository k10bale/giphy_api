# giphy_api

welcome to my giphy page!

still a work in progress. 

1) I couldnt figure out how to style the buttons being rendered in JS, or any button at all- I could only do internal CSS, and that was tricky. I couldnt get it to read my external css page. 

2) Need to add a click function to pause and resume gifs. 

3) Make it look nicer.
